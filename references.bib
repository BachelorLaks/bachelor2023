	abstract = {Harvesting, processing, and exporting of seafood are longheld traditions in Norway due to its vast marine resources. In the 1970s, Norway became an international leader in marine aquaculture. The seafood industry is of great importance to the Norwegian economy. This paper documents the seafood industry's direct and indirect effects on Norway's economy from 2004 to 2017. We use a national Input--Output model to quantify to what extent the Norwegian seafood industry has created appreciable effects both in the core industries of the value chain, as well as in the supplier industries and other industries through ripple effects. The total contribution is measured in terms of value added (contribution to GNP) and employment (FTE). We find particularly high growth in total value added generated by the seafood industry during the period. However, within the seafood industry, there are different trends associated with development for the value chain of fisheries and aquaculture. The value chain for aquaculture, which includes its impacts on other industries, is the fastest growing part of the seafood value chain, while fisheries show a more moderate growth. Hence, aquaculture became the dominant part of the Norwegian seafood value chain from 2010 to 2013 and onwards measured in value-added and employment, respectively.},

@article{vukikna94,
	abstract = {The paper compares four state-space methods for modeling nonstationary vector-valued time series. An estimation of covariance model parameters based on the Kung-Vaccaro method is introduced, and the least squares solution to the vector of initial states is derived. Assuming stochastic nonstationarities, a two-step state-space procedure based on the cointegration representation is compared to the procedure based on the error correction representation. Assuming deterministic nonstationarities, the method of adding a regression equation to the innovations model is compared to a new technique that replaces the structural model by an impulse response model. The procedures are compared by generating short term forecasts of salmon wholesale prices in Japan.},

Properties of the regression estimator of p are obtained under the assumption that p = $\pm$1.

The estimator of p and the regression t test furnish methods of testing the hypothesis that p = 1. },
