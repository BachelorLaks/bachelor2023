\section{Theory and literature}

\subsection{Literature review}
At the time of writing this thesis there are only a few papers directly forecasting the price of salmon. These papers use a variety of different methods to forecast the price of salmon. These papers also use numerous features, creating a great starting point and giving insight in to what to focus on and what to disregard in future research. 

\textcite{vukina_1994} is a study that forecasts the price of five different species of salmon in the Tokyo wholesale market. Four state-space models are used to predict and compare the prices by modelling non-stationary time series. When measuring the results by use of MSE and MAPE the results were found to be quite good. The results were also surprisingly good at predicting the correct direction of the price-movement.

This study was followed by \textcite{gu_anderson_1995}. This study combines OLS used to model the seasonality the seasonality removal with a state-space, time-series forecasting method to predict the price for the US salmon market. The result from this study clearly indicates that accounting for seasonal factor significantly increases the forecasting accuracy of the model.

In the study "Short-term salmon price forecasting" by Daumantas Bloznelis 16 different methods are used to forecast 1-5 weeks Atlantic salmon spot prices. Every method \textcite{bloznelis_2017} uses gets the directional movement correct 50\% of the time for all forecasting horizons. For one week prediction k-nearest neighbour gives the best prediction. For two to three weeks prediction a vector error correction model using elastic net regulation gives the best results, and for four to five weeks future prices is the best method.

\subsection{Economic Theory}
\subsubsection{Consumer choice theory}
``Consumer choice theory is the study of how individuals make choices about what goods and services to consume. The theory is based on the assumption that consumeers have preferences for different goods and services and that they will choose the combination of goods and services that maximizes their utility subject to their budget constraints.'' \parencite{Perloff_2017} This means that if you have two types of goods that are exchangeable to some degree, the price of one should affect the price/demand of the other, and vice versa. Based on this notion we intend to test whether this effect exists in our data between salmon prices, cod prices and halibut prices.

\subsubsection{Norwegian fishermen and the market for wild caught fish}\label{Norwegian fishermen and the market for wild caught fish}
To understand where our price data comes from we need to take a look at how wild caught fish are sold in Norway. Wild caught fish in Norway have a heavily monitored way to the consumer. There are laws concerning quality and handling that secures the fish are safe to eat. There are also laws that dictate the way these fish can be sold and who are liable throughout this process. The laws concerning the sales are governed by the act on first hand purchase of wild marine resource. A sales organisation act like a middleman in the transaction between fisherman and fish buyer. They can be compared in likeness to an auction house or exchange, where the fisherman pays a fee to access the exchange to sell their fish. But the fishermen remain as owner of the fish until the time of the transaction. This means that the sales organisation never actually own any of the fish. Through this sales process the Norwegian receipt for fishermen is created.\parencite{Nielsen_2022}

\subsubsection{Exchangeable goods}\label{Exchangeable goods}
We wanted to explore the possibility that one might be able to use prices for similar commodities such as different seafood to help predict the price of salmon. To find the prices of these exchangeable goods we contacted Norsk Råfisklag. They where very helpful and provided us with historic prices data for halibut and cod. The data they provided was gathered using the Norwegian receipt for fishermen also known as a contract note. The receipt is a concept that is unique to Norway. The receipt contains both the quantity of fish caught as well as the sales value of these fish and a plethora of other information. It has a number of purpose such as paying the fishermen, creating the invoice for the buyer, controlling that the quota of fish is upheld, contributing to the Norwegian statistics for wild caught fish, and more. We use data from these receipts to gather the week by week historic prices for halibut and cod. Norges Råfisklag, who provides the data, is an entity created by the industry to make sure it upholds its responsibility to the rest of the society. It is also responsible for securing a fair and transparent industry for workers and the environment. This makes it a great reliable source of data.\parencite{Harland_2022}

\subsubsection{Currency change}\label{Currency change}
As mentioned, the salmon market is an export market. This in turn means that the prices are affected by the changes in between the NOK and the currency of the markets that it is exported to. To account for this, we have added Norges Bank's TWI to the dataset. ``The TWI is a nominal effective krone exchange rate calculated on the basis of NOK exchange rates against the currencies of Norway's 25 main trading partners.'' \parencite{norges_bank_2020} A rise in the value of the index indicates that the exchange rate of NOK depreciates.

\subsection{Exploratory analysis}
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a method used to analyse datasets and summarize the main characteristics. It helps determine how best to manipulate data sources to get the answers needed. This makes it easier to discover patterns, anomalies, test hypotheses or checking assumptions. 

There are 4 steps involved in an exploratory data analysis: data collection, data cleaning, univariate analysis and bivariate analysis. 
Data collection simply consists of gathering the data needed for the analysis. 
Data cleaning is the process of removing or replacing missing values, outliers, and other anomalies. Anomalies can disproportionally skew the data and hence adversely affect the results.~\parencite{biswal_2023}
Univariate analysis is analysis the data of only one variable. This is usually done by creating a histogram, boxplot or a frequency table.  
Bivariate analysis uses the data of two variables and compares them to each other. This establishes the correlation (or lack of) between the two variables. This is usually done by creating a correlation matrix or by plotting the data in a scatterplot. 

\subsection{Regression}
Regression analysis is a reliable method of identifying which variables have impact on a topic of interest. Regression analysis consists of two types of variables: dependent and independent. The dependent variable is the main variable or factor that the model is trying to predict or understand. The independent variables are the factors that is hypothesized to have an impact on the chosen dependent variable. 

Linear regression models often use a "least-squares approach" to determine a line of best fit (regression line) to a given dataset. This line is the yellow line in the figure below. A square is the squared distance between a datapoint and the regression line. These values needs to be squared in order to not counteract each other.

    \caption[Depiction of a regression analysis]{Depiction of a regression analysis.~\cite{hyndman_athanasopoulos_2021}}\label{fig:Regression}
\end{figure}

When the process above has been completed a regression model is constructed. The general form of a multiple linear regression model is:  
\begin{equation}
    Y = a + b_1X_1 + b_2X_2 + b_3X_3 + ... + b_tX_t + u
\end{equation}
Where Y is the dependent variable, X is the independent variable(s), a is the y-intercept, b is the slope of the explanatory variable(s) and u is the residual or error term.

\subsection{ARIMA --- SARIMAX}\label{ARIMATheory}

The ARIMA-model is one of the more popular and useful approaches to time series forecasting. The name is an acronym that stands for AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average and the model utilizes these in order to predict future values solely on earlier values, it is therefore an univariate model. In order for the model to be able to predict, the data has to be stationary, which means that the mean, variance and covariance are constant over time. Time-series data is especially prone to be non-stationary, which can be solved either by log-transforming the data, convert it to a percentage change or by differencing which is further explained in~\ref{IntegratedTheory}.

The SARIMAX-model is an extension of the ARIMA-model that also takes external factors and seasonality into account in order to better predict future values. SARIMAX can therefore be a multivariate model. \parencite{hyndman_athanasopoulos_2021}

\subsubsection{Auto Regressive (AR)}\label{AutoRegressiveTheory}
The first part of the ARIMA acronym is the Auto Regressive part. Auto comes from the Greek word autos and mean self, in this context it means that the model is regressing on itself. This part of the model can be written as follows:
\begin{equation}
y_{t} = c + \phi_{1}y_{t-1} + \phi_{2}y_{t-2} + \cdots + \phi_{p}y_{t-p} + \varepsilon_{t}
\end{equation}

Where c is a constant, $p$ is the number of lag observations or autoregressive terms, $\phi$ are the AR coefficients and $\varepsilon_{t}$ is the error term. $y_{t}$ is the data on which the AR-model is applied on. (\cite{oracle_ARIMA}) This model is a ``pure'' AR-model and relies therefore solely on its own lags. If $p$ is set to 1, the model looks at the previous value and tries to predict the next value. If $p$ is set to 2, the model looks at the previous two values and tries to predict the next value, and so on. (\cite{artley_2022})


\subsubsection{Integrated (I)}\label{IntegratedTheory}
The second part of the ARIMA acronym is the Integrated part. This part of the model is used to make the time series stationary. In the ARIMA-equation it is represented by the letter $d$ and is the number of differencing required to make the time series stationary. Usually, the optimal amount of differencing is the least amount needed to make the data fluctuate around a well-defined mean. (\cite{nau_2019}) It is the only form of converting the data to a stationary form that the ARIMA-model itself can do. Log-transforming and converting to a percentage change can only be done before the model is applied on the data. 

\subsubsection{Moving Average (MA)}\label{MovingAverageTheory}
The third and last part of the ARIMA acronym is the Moving Average part. This incorporates the dependency of an observation on the residual errors from a moving average model applied to lagged observations. \parencite{hayes_2019} This part of the model can be written as follows:
\begin{equation}
\hat{y} = c + \theta_1\epsilon_{t-1} + \theta_2\epsilon_{t-2} + \cdots + \theta_q\epsilon_{t-q}
\end{equation}

Where c is a constant, $q$ is the order of the moving average, i.e the number of lagged forecast errors. $\theta$ are the MA coefficients and $\varepsilon_{t}$ is the error term. For example, if $q$ is 1, the output relies solely on the errors from the previous time step. If $q$ is 2, the output relies on the errors from the previous two-time steps. (\cite{hyndman_athanasopoulos_2021}) 

Combining these three parts of the ARIMA-model, we get the following general forecasting equation:
\begin{equation}
\hat{y}_t = c + \phi_1y_{t-1} + \phi_2y_{t-2} + \cdots + \phi_py_{t-p} + \theta_1\epsilon_{t-1} + \theta_2\epsilon_{t-2} + \cdots + \theta_q\epsilon_{t-q} + \epsilon_t
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Seasonality (S)}\label{SeasonalityTheory}
For time-series data there can often incur a seasonal trend which is a pattern that repeats itself over a period of time. For example, pollution levels in a city that might increase in the winter and decrease in the summer. This trend can be accounted for by adding a seasonal component to the model and where the ARIMA-model is written as ARIMA$(p,d,q)$, the SARIMA-model is written as SARIMA$(p,d,q) \times (P,D,Q)s$. Uppercase P, D and Q corresponds to the lowercase p, d and q, namely the AR, I and MA terms, but for the seasonal component. The $s$ is the number of periods in a season, for example if the data is measured daily, $s$ would be 7 if the seasonal trend is weekly.~\parencite{chang_et_al_2012}

\subsubsection{Exogenous variables (X)}\label{ExogenousTheory}
In addition to adding seasonality to the ARIMA model, one can also include exogenous variables and turn it into a multivariate model. This is often used when there is a clear correlation between the exogenous variable and the time series. For example, if the ARIMA model is used to predict the price of electricity, one could include weather data as one or several exogenous variables.~\parencite{elamin_fukushige_2018}

\subsection{Neural networks}
\subsubsection{Recurrent Neural Network}
A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a special type of artificial neural network adapted for work with time series data or data that involves sequences. \parencite{saeed_2021} 
By adding a "feedback loop" RNNs are able to step through sequential input data while persisting the state of nodes in the hidden layer between steps. This is called "working memory". The hidden node concatenates its current input and the working memory from the previous steps before the result is passed on to an activation function. The output from the activation function is then sent onwards to both the output layer, and forwarded on to the next iteration of the RNN (as the working memory).~\parencite{bouvet_2020}

    \caption[Depiction of an unrolled recurrent neural network]{Depiction of an unrolled recurrent neural network.~\cite{khalajani_2023}}\label{fig:RNN}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Long Short-Term Memory} 
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a network specifically designed to overcome the long-term dependency problem faced by RNNs. 
A typical LSTM network consists of three gates; the input gate, the forget gate and the output gate.
These gates control how the information in a sequence of data comes into, is stored, and leaves the network.  

The forget gate will decide which bits of the cell state are useful, given both the previous hidden state and the new input data. 
This is done by feeding the previous hidden state and the new input data into a neural network, which uses the sigmoid activation to output a number between 0 and 1, where 0 means "forget", and 1 means "remember". 
The output of the forget gate is then multiplied with the previous cell state. An output value of close to 0 means that the cell state will have less influence on the following steps. 

The input gate and new memory network will determine what information should be added to the networks cell state, given the previous hidden state and new input data. The inputs in this gate are the same as in the forget gate. 
Here there is created a neural network with a tanh activation function, to combine the previous hidden state and the new input data and generate a "new memory update vector". This vector decides how much to update each component of the cell state of the network, given the data. 
Since the tanh activation function is used the outputs of this neural network will be between -1 and 1. 
This new memory vector does not actually take into account whether the input data is worth remembering. 
Therefore, the input gate is a sigmoid activated network which filters which components of the new memory vector are worth retaining. 
The output of the new memory vector and the input gate is then multiplied, and the combined vector is added to the cell state. 

The output gate uses the newly updated cell state, the previous hidden state and the new input data to decide the new hidden state. 
The inputs in the output gate are the previous hidden state, and the new input data, and this is fed into a sigmoid activated neural network. 
This works as a filter, so that the output gate doesn't simply output everything it knows about something, and instead only outputs the most relevant information. 
Before this output can be used as the new hidden state, the cell state has to be passed through a tanh activation function, in order to force the values to be between -1 and 1 (so called "squished cell state"). 
When this is done the output from the output gate and the squished cell state are then multiplied. This outputs the new hidden state.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Tensorflow}
Tensorflow is an open source library for numerical computation that makes machine learning and developing neural networks faster and easier.~\parencite{yegulalp_2018}
It works by allowing the user to define a graph of computations that are then executed by the library. The graph is defined by the user by creating nodes that represent mathematical operations, and edges that represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) communicated between them. 
The library then optimizes the graph for execution on a CPU or GPU.
\subsubsection{Sigmoid function}
The Sigmoid function is given as:
\begin{equation}
    S(x) = \frac{e^x}{e^x+1}
\end{equation}
Since: 
\begin{equation}
    \lim_{x \to \infty}S(x) = \frac{\infty}{\infty+1} \approx \frac{\infty}{\infty} = 1
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \lim_{x \to 0}S(x) = \frac{0}{0+1} = \frac{0}{1} = 0
\end{equation}
The Sigmoid function will only output values between 0 and 1. 
\subsubsection{Hyperbolic tangent function}
The hyperbolic tangent function is given as:
\begin{equation}
    S(x) = \frac{sinh(x)}{cosh(x)} = \frac{e^x-e^{-x}}{e^x+e^{-x}}
\end{equation}
Since:
\begin{equation}
    \lim_{x \to \infty}tanh(x) = \frac{\infty - 0}{\infty + 0} = \frac{\infty}{\infty} = 1
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \lim_{x \to -\infty}tanh(x) = \frac{0 - \infty}{0 + \infty} = \frac{-\infty}{\infty} = -1
\end{equation}
The hyperbolic tangent function will only output values between -1 and 1.
