\section{Theory and literature}

Relevant theory will be: 
We envision using economic theories such as market equilibrium, Pareto efficiency and consumer choice theory. 
Statistical theory, such as the presumptions for regression to evaluate whether our data sources meet the requirements, and our model is robust. 
Neural networks, especially LSTM compared to other predictive models

\subsection{ARIMA}
An autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA) is a form of regression analysis that gauges the strength of one dependent variable relative to other changing variables (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/autoregressive-integrated-moving-average-arima.asp). The method is used to forecast future outcomes based on historical data. 

The \textbf{ARIMA(p,d,q)} model can be defined as: 
$$\hat{y'}_t = c + \phi_1y'_{t-1} + \phi_2y'_{t-2} + ... + \phi_py'_{t-p} + \theta_1\epsilon_{t-1} + \theta_2\epsilon_{t-2} + ... + \theta_q\epsilon_{t-q} + \epsilon_t$$

Where \textbf{AutoRegressive - AR(p)}, is a regression model with lagged values of y, until p-th time in the past, as predictors. Here, p = the number of lagged observations in the model, $\epsilon$ is white noise at time t, c is a constant and Ï†s are parameters. (https://www.capitalone.com/tech/machine-learning/understanding-arima-models/) 
$$\hat{y}_t = c + \phi_1y_{t-1} + \phi_2y_{t-2} + ... + \phi_py_{t-p} 
+ \epsilon_t$$

\textbf{Integrated - I(d)}, is the difference taken d times until the original series becomes stationary. A stationary time series is one whose properties do not depend on the time at which the series is observed.
$$By_t = y_{t-1}$$ 
$$y'_t = y_t - y_{t-1} = (1 - B)y_t$$
$$y'_t = (1-B)^dy_t$$

\textbf{Moving average - MA(q)}, is a formula for using a regression-like model on past forecast errors. Here, $\epsilon$ is white noise at time t, c is a constant, and $\theta$s are parameters
$$\hat{y} = c + \theta_1\epsilon_{t-1} + \theta_2\epsilon_{t-2} + ... + \theta_q\epsilon_{t-q}$$

(bad long-term-forecasting because it is backward looking. Also a lot of subjectivity involved in identifying p and q parameters). 


\subsection{Exploratory analysis}
\textbf{Exploratory data analysis (EDA} is a method used to analyse datasets and summarize the main characteristics. It helps determine how best to manipulate datasources to get the answers needed. This makes it easier to discover patterns, anomalies, test hypotheses or checking assumptions (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiqZliDXCCg).
