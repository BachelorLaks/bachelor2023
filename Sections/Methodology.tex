\section{Methodology}

We intend to utilize the following methods:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[--] Exploratory analysis
    \item[--] Regression, https://www.alchemer.com/resources/blog/regression-analysis/
    \item[--] ARIMA, https://www.machinelearningplus.com/time-series/arima-model-time-series-forecasting-python/
    \item[--] LSTM --- Tensorflow
    \end{itemize}

\subsection{Data gathering}
In order to analyze data connected to salmon price, we first need to gather this data. 
The main data point is the price of salmon. There are several sources for this data, but we utilized the data from the NASDAQ salmon exchange.
The reason for this being a combination of the accessibility of the data, and the fact that the NASDAQ salmon exchange (NQSALMON)
uses a wighted average for the salmon price, gathered from a spectrum of salmon exporters and it is therefore the best source of meaningful data.
Another reason for using the NASDAQ salmon exchange is that the data is updated weekly with no missing values for the entire time frame.
We downloaded data from March 2013 through December 2022, for a total of 507 data points. This was our base for the independent factors.

The next step was to gather data from the other relevant factors for our analysis.
