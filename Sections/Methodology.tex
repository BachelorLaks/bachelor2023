\section{Methodology}

We intend to utilize the following methods:\\
- Tensor flow \\
- ARIMA, https://www.machinelearningplus.com/time-series/arima-model-time-series-forecasting-python/ \\
One condition for ARIMA is that the data is stationary. (\cite[p.~291]{hyndman_athanasopoulos_2021})
- Exploratory analysis \\
- Regression, https://www.alchemer.com/resources/blog/regression-analysis/\\ 
- LSTM\\
- Neural networks
