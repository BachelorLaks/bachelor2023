This bachelor thesis marks the end of our degree in Business Administration with specialization in Business Analytics at NTNU Handelshøyskolen. Throughout the process of writing this thesis we have enhanced our understanding of analytical modelling, as well as seeing how it can be applied in a real world setting. 

We would like to take the opportunity to thank our supervisor, Denis Becker, for his guidance and support throughout the project. His inputs and engagement in regards to the topic has been greatly appreciated. We would also like to thank Gunnar Johnsen at Norges Råfisklag for providing us with the data that our models are built upon.    

The contents of the thesis is at the expense of the authors.
