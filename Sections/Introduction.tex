1. Our problem: “Predicting the pricing of salmon using similar commodities and macroeconomic factors” 

In 2022 Norway exported 226 000 tons of seafood totaling a value of 10.30 billion NOK. Of this export 95 000 tons where salmon with it´s value being 8,94 billion of the total 10,30 billion NOK.(kilde 1) Making it by far the most important produce for the Norwegian seafood industry.

The salmon industry is one of the biggest industries in Norway. The companies in the 	industry impact the rest of the Norwegian economy and society as a whole through labor and culture. Predicting the price of salmon would help to predict the future of these 	companies short term and their impact. 
It is relevant in Business analytics as we will be creating a model using methods and logic form the course and its highly relevant in the economy today as it has been quite a turbulent market given the recent discussion about tax increase for the industry especially.
